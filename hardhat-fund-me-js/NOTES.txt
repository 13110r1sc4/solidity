yarn hardhat  

LINTING

solhint is a solidity linter, to lint our code -> to analysis code for potential
errors
prettier -> to format
solhint -> to lint

yarn add --dev solhint
// add solhint to devDep
arn solhint contracts/*.sol   

yarn hardhat clean -> if it doe not compile
yarn hardhat compile

yarn add hardhat-deploy 
-> isntall package to deploy so we do not use the script

yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers
-> to add hardhat-ethers but liek this ethers overrides hardhat to keep track of deployment

yarn hardhat deploy 
-> with this command we run the files in teh deploy folder -> good practise is to number the files

MOCKING


if i do yarn hardhat compile , and then deploy, and then node -> i have a local node and all the contracts deployed vefore are already
in the blockchain

TESTING

unit test are done locally
- local hardhat

-> yarn hardhat coverage

staging tests
