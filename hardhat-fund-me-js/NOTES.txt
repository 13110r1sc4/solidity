INITIALIZE PROJECT FROM SCRATCH

yarn add --dev hardhat
yarn hardhat  

LINTING

solhint is a solidity linter, to lint our code -> to analysis code for potential
errors
prettier -> to format
solhint -> to lint

yarn add --dev solhint
// add solhint to devDep
arn solhint contracts/*.sol   

yarn hardhat clean -> if it doe not compile
yarn hardhat compile

yarn add hardhat-deploy 
-> isntall package to deploy so we do not use the script

yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers
-> to add hardhat-ethers but liek this ethers overrides hardhat to keep track of deployment

yarn hardhat deploy 
-> with this command we run the files in teh deploy folder -> good practise is to number the files

MOCKING


if i do yarn hardhat compile , and then deploy, and then node -> i have a local node and all the contracts deployed vefore are already
in the blockchain

TESTING

unit test are done locally
- local hardhat
-forked hardhat
-> yarn hardhat coverage

staging tests



NB: you can use console.log in solidity


OPCODES
in artifacts/buildinfo we can see the opcodes: they represent what the machine is doing and how much computational work it takes to 
run our code
https://github.com/crytic/evm-opcodes
-> find the cost for functions. we can se that save a word to storage requires a lot of gas! 


RUN WITH LOCAL node
yarn hardhat node
-> move back to bash terminal
yarn hardhat deploy --NETWORK LOCALHOST
yarn hardhat run scripts/fund.js --network localhost
