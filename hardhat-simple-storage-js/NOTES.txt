Yarn hardhat node 
-> to run local node, which is a different network than 
the default hardhat network we used before and that does not keep track of contracts. 
It’s hardhat but in the sense that it allows us to run a node -> no need for accounts, 
chainId is same as default hardhat network and is 31337

yarn hardhat console --newtwork localhost
-> hardhat has the console we can use to use around the blockchain. 
Works for hardhat and sepolia networks (all of them)

Yarn hardhat clean 
-> to delete the artefacts folder and clean the cache folder


TESTS

We can run tests that are placed in the folder tests.

yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat test --grep store 
-> the store word is in the second function only so it runs the store test
NB: if I add it.only in the code, it will only do that test without specifying

yarn add hardhat-gas-reporter —dev
->install package and let’s see how much gas fee do our functions need


SOLIDITY COVERAGE
